 * The straight-line method for computing the yearly depreciation in value D for an
 * item is given by the following formula:
 *
 * D = (P â€“ S)/Y
 *
 * where P is the purchase price, S is the salvage value, and Y is the number of years
 * the item is used. Write a program that takes as input the purchase price of an item,
 * the expected number of years of service, and the expected salvage value.
 * The program should then output the yearly depreciation for the item.
