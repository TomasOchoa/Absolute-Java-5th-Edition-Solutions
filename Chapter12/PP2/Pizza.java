/**
    The Pizza class contains information about a specific pizza. The variables of
 pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms are booleans that indicate whether or not
 these toppings are present on the pizza. The size variable is a character of value 's',
 'm', or 'l' to indicate small, medium, or large. There is also a Pizza constructor
 that initializes all of these values. The getSize() method returns the size of the
 pizza and the getNumToppings() method returns a number from 0â€“3 depending
 on what toppings are present (e.g., if the pizza has pepperoni and mushrooms, it
 would be 2).
