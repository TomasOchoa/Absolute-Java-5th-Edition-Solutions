/**
 * Created by Tom's Desktop on 3/10/2016.
 *
 *      You operate several hot dog stands distributed throughout town. Define a class
 * named HotDogStand that has;
 *      1. An instance variable for the hot dog standâ€™s ID number
 *      2. An instance variable for how many hot dogs the stand has sold that day
 *
 *      - Create a constructor that allows a user of the class to initialize both values
 *
 *      - Create a method named justSold that increments by one the number of hot
 *        dogs the stand has sold
 *        - The idea is that this method will be invoked each time the stand sells a hot dog
 *          so that you can track the total number of hot dogs sold by the stand.
 *
 *      - A method that returns the number of hot dogs sold
 *      - A static variable that tracks the total number of hot dogs sold by all hot dog stands
 *      - A static method that returns the value in this variable
 *
 *      - Write a main method to test your class with at least three hot dog stands that each
 *      sell a variety of hot dogs.
