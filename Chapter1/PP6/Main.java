/**
 *  Bicyclists can calculate their speed if the gear size and cadence is known. Gear size
 *  refers to the effective diameter of the wheel. Gear size multiplied by pi (3.14) gives
 *  the distance travelled with one turn of the pedals. Cadence refers to the number of
 *  pedal revolutions per minute (rpm). The speed in miles per hour is calculated by
 *  the following:
 *
 *  Speed(mph) = Gear Size(inches) * pi * 1(ft)/12(inches) * 1(mile)/5280(ft) * Cadence(rpm) * 60(minutes)/(hour)
 *
 *  This is a program that calculates the speed for a gear size of 100 inches and a
 *  cadence of 90 rpm. This would be considered a high cadence and a maximum gear
 *  size for a typical bicycle. In writing your program, donâ€™t forget that the expression
 *  1/12 will result in 0, because both 1 and 12 are integers, and when the integer
 *  division is performed, the fractional part is discarded.
