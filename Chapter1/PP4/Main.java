/**
 *  A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener commonly
 * used in diet soda pop will cause death in laboratory mice. A friend of yours is
 * desperate to lose weight but cannot give up soda pop. Your friend wants to know
 * how much diet soda pop it is possible to drink without dying as a result. Write a
 * program to supply the answer. The program has no input but does have defined
 * constants for the following items: the amount of artificial sweetener needed to kill
 * a mouse, the weight of the mouse, the starting weight of the dieter, and the desired
 * weight of the dieter. To ensure the safety of your friend, be sure the program uses
 * the weight at which the dieter will stop dieting, rather than the dieterâ€™s current
 * weight, to calculate how much soda pop the dieter can safely drink. You may use
 * any reasonable values for these defined constants. Assume that diet soda contains
 * 1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener. Use another named constant for this fraction.
 * You may want to express the percent as the double value 0.001. (If your program
 * turns out not to use a defined constant, you may remove that defined constant
 * from your program.)
