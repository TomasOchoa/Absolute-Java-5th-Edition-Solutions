# Absolute Java (5th Edition)
### Purpose:
- Repo that holds the solutions I created for chapter's practice programming projects
- Not all chapters completed, and not all problems are done within chapters
- **NOTE:**
    - I am sharing these solutions to the world due to an observation I made during college. I came to the realization that people, in general, learn in many different ways, and some need to see what their learning/studying first to grasp the concept then. 
    - **These solutions are shared with the intention for you to use them as an aid or guide when creating your own.**
    - Not putting in the effort to do the work only hurts you, in the long run, so please I plead you to not copy these solutions.
